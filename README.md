This android app was written by me in 2012.
Therefore- it is not recommended to be used as 'android developing learning source' because it was written by "inexperienced 2012 me".
Also, it contains code that could be irrelevent today or older implementation methods that could be written today by newer methods. 

# Privacy policy

This is an open source Android app developed by me. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email (gennady9@gmail.com) and I will surely try to fix it/help you. Thanks!
